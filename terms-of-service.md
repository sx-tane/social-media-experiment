# 📄 **Terms of Service**

Welcome to **Napboat Studio**! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our services, including any automated content posting, visual generation, or related tools made available via our TikTok-integrated application.

By using Napboat Studio, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1. **About the Service**

Napboat Studio is a creative tool that uses AI to generate calming, dreamlike images and captions. These are posted automatically to your TikTok account, with your permission, through TikTok’s Content Posting API.

This app is intended for **personal creative use only**.

### 2. **Use of the TikTok API**

Our service uses TikTok’s Login Kit and Content Posting API to:

* Authenticate your TikTok account
* Post generated content to your account (with your approval)

You authorize Napboat Studio to act on your behalf for these limited purposes. You may revoke access at any time via your TikTok settings.

### 3. **User Responsibility**

You agree not to use Napboat Studio to post or distribute content that is:

* Harmful, abusive, illegal, or violates TikTok’s Community Guidelines
* Misleading, infringing, or harmful to any third party

You are solely responsible for the content published on your TikTok account.

### 4. **Ownership of Content**

All visual content is generated using third-party AI services (e.g. OpenAI, DALL·E, or Stable Diffusion). You are free to use, modify, or delete the content as you wish. Napboat Studio does not claim ownership of any AI-generated media.
